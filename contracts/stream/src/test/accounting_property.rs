//!
//! `accrual::withdrawable` is `vested - withdrawn` and `accrual::refundable` is
//! `deposited - vested`, so their sum is exactly the stream's outstanding
//! liability `deposited - withdrawn`: every stroop the contract still holds is
//! either already earned by the recipient (withdrawable) or still locked and
//! refundable to the sender. `test::accounting_identity` (#1711) pins that
//! identity for hand-picked instants and a handful of fixed sequences. This
//! module promotes it to a property **generated across randomized operation
//! sequences**: each proptest case is a distinct seed expanded into a mixed
//! sequence of `create` / `top_up` / `withdraw` / `pause` / `resume` / `cancel`
//! / `transfer_recipient` / `extend_stream_ttl` calls interleaved with clock
//! advances, and the identity is re-checked through the public views
//! (`withdrawable_of`, `refundable_of`) *and* the pure `accrual` helpers after
//! every step, for every stream.
//!
//! The sequence deliberately reaches the states a fixed-fixture test cannot:
//! multiple concurrent streams, partial draws, a pause that spans a cliff,
//! top-ups that move the rate, cancellation mid-schedule, maturity, and
//! depletion. Failed entry-point calls are expected and ignored — the
//! property is about what the *state* must satisfy afterwards, not about which
//! random operations the contract happened to accept.
//!
//! # Reproducibility
//!
//! A case is fully identified by the `(seed, steps)` pair proptest reports on
//! failure, and every assertion message names both. To replay a reported seed
//! exactly, without the proptest runner:
//!
//! ```text
//! ACCOUNTING_PROPERTY_SEED=<seed> ACCOUNTING_PROPERTY_STEPS=<steps> \
//!   cargo test -p fluxora-stream accounting_property -- --nocapture
//! ```
//!
//! `reported_seed_replays` honours those two variables; proptest's own
//! `PROPTEST_CASES` continues to size the generated sweep as it does for
//! `test::props`.
