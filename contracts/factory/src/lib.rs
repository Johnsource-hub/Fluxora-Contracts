//! # Fluxora factory — admin policy wrapper
//!
//! The factory is the *policy* half of Fluxora. The
//! [`FluxoraStream`](https://github.com/Fluxora-Org/Fluxora-Contracts)
//! contract is deliberately a primitive: it has no admin, no pause switch and
//! no fees, because those are exactly the powers that make a streaming
//! primitive unsafe to build on. Anything an operator needs to configure —
//! who may receive, how large a deposit may be, how short a schedule may be,
//! whether new streams are paused — lives here instead, one layer up.
//!
//! This contract owns no tokens and moves no funds. It stores a small set of
//! policy knobs, all of them in **instance storage**, and exposes admin
//! setters plus read-only views over them.
//!
//! ## Instance TTL policy
//!
//! Every state-changing entry point — [`FluxoraFactory::init`] and each admin
//! setter — calls [`bump_instance`], which pins the contract's instance entry
//! to the network maximum, `env.storage().max_ttl()`.
//!
//! This is the same policy the stream contract applies to its instance entry
//! (`fluxora_stream::storage::extend_instance`): instance storage is tiny and
//! holds the whole admin configuration, so it is kept at maximum rent on every
//! mutation rather than being allowed to decay toward some watermark. An
//! actively-administered factory therefore never lets its configuration
//! archive, and an idle factory is brought back to a full TTL window by the
//! first setter call after the gap — the setter reads and writes instance
//! storage, so the bump repairs the entry as part of the same transaction.
//!
//! Read-only views ([`FluxoraFactory::get_factory_config`],
//! [`FluxoraFactory::is_factory_paused`], [`FluxoraFactory::is_allowlisted`])
//! deliberately do **not** bump TTL. They can run in simulation, and a view
//! that paid rent would be an observable behaviour change for callers who only
//! want to read state. This mirrors the stream contract's rule that views never
//! extend TTL.
//!
//! ## Immutability posture
//!
//! There is no upgrade entry point. A change to the policy *set* itself (not
//! its values) is a new deployment. Individual values are mutable by the
//! admin, which is the point: a cap that could never be raised would make the
//! factory useless the first time it was set too low.
