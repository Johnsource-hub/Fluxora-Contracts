# Fluxora

**A continuous payment streaming primitive for Soroban.**

Lock tokens once; have them accrue continuously to a recipient over time. The
recipient pulls their accrued balance whenever they like.

Fluxora is the layer other things build on — payroll tools, grant programs,
subscription billing, vesting schedules. The contract is the product.

## Quick start

```bash
cargo test                                    # full suite
cargo test resource_limits -- --nocapture     # print measured resource costs

# Deeper randomized sweep. CI runs this nightly; worth running before a release
# or after touching accrual.rs. Both suites have found real bugs.
FLUXORA_FUZZ_SEEDS=200 FLUXORA_FUZZ_STEPS=300 PROPTEST_CASES=5000 cargo test --release
```

## Building and releasing

The **product** contract (`contracts/stream`) builds to `fluxora_stream.wasm`.

**Release artifacts come from `script/release.sh` only.** It builds exactly the
product package, downloads nothing else, and refuses to produce an artifact if the
archival probe's wasm would be swept in:

```bash
script/release.sh      # -> target/wasm32v1-none/release/fluxora_stream.wasm (only)
```

> The archival probe (see below) is a workspace member so its smoke test stays
> wired into `cargo test`, but it is deliberately excluded from release artifacts.
> Never deploy it to mainnet. See
> [`contracts/archival-probe/src/lib.rs`](contracts/archival-probe/src/lib.rs).

**The full sequence — every script, the `deploy_target` input, who may trigger a
mainnet deploy, and rollback — is in
[docs/RELEASE.md](docs/RELEASE.md).** Follow that document end to end; the
sections above are only the short version.

---

## Release integrity

Every contract wasm is released with a provenance manifest tying its bytes to
the git revision, Rust toolchain, soroban-sdk version, target triple and
release profile, plus a SHA-256 digest per artifact (see
[docs/provenance.md](docs/provenance.md)). Verification is mandatory — a
mismatch fails the release:

```bash
script/provenance.sh build   # wasm build + generate + verify (the release gate)
script/provenance.sh verify  # re-check the current build
```

---

## Design

### Pull-based, because Stellar has no scheduler

There is no cron, no keeper network, no way for a contract to wake itself up.
Every state change must be triggered by an external transaction. Nothing here
runs in the background: the recipient calls `withdraw` and the contract computes
what they have earned at that instant.

### No on-chain stream discovery

There is deliberately **no per-user index** in storage. A `Vec<u64>` of a
treasury's streams grows without bound, costs rent forever, and blows Soroban's
transaction footprint limit once that treasury has a few hundred recipients. On
chain, a stream is only ever addressed by its `u64` id.

Discovery is an off-chain concern. `create_stream` returns the new id and emits
an event carrying sender, recipient and every schedule field, so an indexer can
answer "show me my streams" without the contract paying rent to remember.

`test::resource_limits::cost_is_independent_of_how_many_streams_exist` states
this as a test: the 153rd stream costs exactly what the 2nd did.

### Deliberately immutable

The deployed stream contract is **not upgradeable in place**. It has no admin
key and exposes no upgrade entry point; changing the implementation requires a
new deployment at a new address. This is a deliberate trust property, not a
missing operational procedure: a recipient's stream guarantees cannot later be
changed by an administrator. See the [ABI reference](docs/ABI.md#upgrade-posture).

`cancellable`, `pausable` and `transferable` are fixed at creation and can never
change. Before accepting a stream a recipient can verify that the sender cannot
claw it back, freeze it, or reassign it. A stream that could *become* cancellable
later would be worthless as a guarantee.

For the same reason there is no fee switch and no global pause. Immutability is
what lets another protocol depend on this one.

---

## The accrual model

Everything is expressed against a **stream clock** that stops while the stream is
paused:

```
stream_time(now) = paused_at.unwrap_or(now) - paused_total

elapsed  = clamp(stream_time, start_time, end_time) - start_time
vested   = 0                                    if stream_time < cliff_time
         = deposited * elapsed / duration       otherwise   (rounds down)
```

All arithmetic is checked and every failure is a typed error. Nothing panics on
a numeric edge case.

**Rounding is always down.** Truncating in the recipient's disfavour is correct:
the residue stays in the pool and returns to the sender at settlement, so the
contract can never owe more than it holds.

**The cliff gates, it does not delay.** At `cliff_time` the recipient becomes
entitled to everything accrued *since `start_time`* — not merely what accrues
after the cliff. This is standard vesting semantics and it surprises people.

**Which clock the cliff is judged on is a per-stream choice.** A stream carries
a `cliff_mode`, fixed at creation:

```
cliff_mode = Schedule  (default)   gate opens when stream_time >= cliff_time
cliff_mode = WallClock             gate opens when now        >= cliff_time
```

On the default `Schedule` mode a pause slides the cliff along with the schedule,
so the gate opens at `cliff_time + paused_total`. That is the historical
behaviour and it is what `create_stream` produces. `WallClock` judges the gate
against the ledger timestamp instead, so a sender pausing the stream can no
longer move the recipient's unlock instant — while accrual still stops while
paused, so the pre-cliff backlog is released in one go on resume. Create one
with `create_stream_with_cliff_mode(..., CliffMode::WallClock, ...)`; the mode is
returned by `get_stream` and published in the `stream_created` event.

**Conservation is exact.** For all `t`:

```
vested(t) + refundable(t) == deposited
```

with no dust term. That falls out of computing `vested` from the cumulative
formula rather than by summing per-interval deltas — truncation error is
re-derived from scratch on every call instead of accumulating. The obvious
per-interval implementation, which the existing MVPs use, loses a stroop per
withdrawal and strands it in the pool forever. Verified by property test over
random schedules and withdrawal patterns.

### Pause

Pausing freezes the clock and pushes the effective end forward by the paused
duration. Total value delivered stays constant; the schedule stretches. The
recipient can still withdraw while paused — pausing stops *accrual*, not access.
Freezing earned funds would make pausable streams unacceptable to any serious
recipient.

A stream paused across its cliff does not silently pass the cliff while frozen — on a `Schedule` stream the gate is pushed back by the paused time, and on a `WallClock` stream it is not, which is the whole point of the mode.

### Cancel

Rather than a second state machine, cancellation rewrites the schedule so the
stream looks like one that has fully matured: `deposited` drops to the amount
vested right now, and `end_time` is pulled back to the current point on the
stream clock. Every later `vested` call clamps to the reduced deposit, so
`withdraw` needs no special-casing at all.

Cancelling before the cliff refunds everything — pre-cliff the recipient's
entitlement is zero by definition.

---

## Decisions

The spec left four questions open. All four are settled, and the reasoning is in
the code where the behaviour lives.

### 1. `top_up` extends the duration; it never raises the rate

```
before:  10_000 over 100 days  ->  100/day, ends day 100
top_up(1_000)
after:   11_000 over 110 days  ->  100/day, ends day 110
```

The per-second rate the recipient agreed to never changes. The alternative —
hold `end_time` and raise the rate — retroactively re-vests elapsed time: a
top-up at the halfway point would instantly increase what is already
withdrawable. Keeping the rate fixed means a top-up can never accelerate or
dilute an existing schedule, which is what makes it safe to accept a stream from
an untrusted sender.

The extension rounds **down**, and that direction is load-bearing rather than
cosmetic. Rounding *up* makes the new duration slightly longer than exact, which
lowers the rate and therefore retroactively *reduces* the amount already vested —
letting `withdrawn` exceed `vested`, and letting a subsequent `cancel` (which
sets `deposited = vested`) drive liability negative and refund the sender money
the recipient already holds. This was a real bug, caught by the randomized
sequence suite; see [docs/KNOWN-LIMITATIONS.md](docs/KNOWN-LIMITATIONS.md) for the class of
issue and `test::top_up::a_top_up_never_reduces_what_is_already_vested` for the
regression. Rounding down guarantees `vested` never decreases; the residual is at
most one second of schedule, in the recipient's favour.

Topping up a *matured* stream is rejected (`StreamMatured`) rather than silently
making the new funds instantly withdrawable. A top-up too small to buy one second
of schedule is rejected (`TopUpTooSmall`), because absorbing it would mean raising
the rate — exactly the retroactive re-vesting this design avoids.

### 2. `MAX_BATCH_SIZE = 16`, derived from measurement

The spec's "roughly 200 ledger entry reads" predates protocol 23. Since then
live Soroban state is held in memory, and `disk_read_entries` is usually zero for
a contract touching live state. Measured against protocol 27's real limits:

| limit | 16-stream batch | ceiling |
|---|---|---|
| total footprint (entries) | 43 | 400 |
| write entries | 20 | 200 |
| instructions | ~4.9M | 400M |
| **contract event bytes** | **9,984** | **16,384** |

Entry counts would allow well over a hundred streams per call. The **event
budget** is what binds: each stream emits a `withdrawn` event plus the token
contract's own `transfer` event, roughly 624 bytes between them, so the hard
ceiling is about 26.

Sixteen is that ceiling with 6,400 bytes of event budget to spare. The margin
matters because the per-stream event cost depends on the *token's* event
payload — a token heavier than the Stellar Asset Contract used in tests would
inflate it, and a cap that merely fits today would fail on somebody else's
token. It was a 2x factor (8,192 bytes) until issue #1868 required every
lifecycle event to name both parties; the `sender` appended to `withdrawn`,
plus the pause bookkeeping that event now republishes, costs 112 bytes per
stream — and `batch_withdraw` emits one `withdrawn` per stream while
`MAX_BATCH_SIZE` is frozen ABI. Re-derive these numbers from
`test::resource_limits` rather than adjusting them by feel.

`batch_cancel` is the one batch call that does not clear 2x on the event budget:
it measures 8 832 bytes at the cap (~552 per element) against the same 16 384
ceiling, so its margin there is ~1.85x — enough for a heavier token, and the
event budget alone would allow ~29 streams. Every other dimension (42 entries of
footprint, 20 writes, ~4.9M instructions) keeps the full 2x margin. The cap is
one number for all three batch calls, so the tightest one sets it; both
measurements are pinned in `test::resource_limits`.

Oversized batches are rejected with `BatchTooLarge` rather than failing opaquely
at the network level. The SDK chunks client-side.

### 3. Minimum deposit: `deposited >= duration`

At least one stroop per second. Below that the rate truncates to zero and the
recipient accrues nothing until very late — a real footgun for a treasury
streaming a small grant over a year. The floor excludes nothing realistic: a
year-long USDC stream needs only ~3.16 USDC to clear it.

### 4. `transfer_recipient` is disableable at creation

A `transferable: bool` flag alongside `cancellable` and `pausable`. A
compliance-bound sender — payroll, a KYC'd grant program — can pin the payee at
creation. Without it those senders simply could not use Fluxora.

Transfer moves the stream's entire remaining claim. Funds already withdrawn
stay with the old recipient; accrued but unwithdrawn funds and all future
accrual belong to the new recipient. The transfer itself changes no schedule or
accounting value, and only the new recipient may withdraw afterward.

---

## TTL, rent and archival

The hardest problem in the project, and the one existing implementations skip.

Persistent entries have a time-to-live in ledgers. When it runs out the entry is
archived. A stream running twelve months outlives its initial TTL. If a stream
entry archives, the **tokens are not lost** — they sit in the contract's pooled
balance — and the accounting entry saying who they belong to is still on the
ledger; the rent that brings it back is paid by whichever invocation next touches
it. On protocol 23 and later that happens automatically, inside that call: the
archived entries named in the transaction's footprint are restored as part of it
and the call proceeds. Measured on testnet — see
[docs/KNOWN-LIMITATIONS.md §1](docs/KNOWN-LIMITATIONS.md).

Three mechanisms:

1. **Extend on every touch.** Every mutating call bumps that entry's TTL, so an
   actively-used stream never expires.
2. **Extend generously at creation**, targeting the stream's remaining lifetime
   plus a 30-day buffer, clamped to the network's `max_entry_ttl`. The clamp is
   not optional — a multi-year stream *will* need periodic extension regardless.
3. **Permissionless `extend_stream_ttl` and `batch_extend_ttl`.** Anyone can pay
   to keep any stream alive. Unauthenticated on purpose: a recipient's claim must
   never depend on the sender's continued goodwill. There is nothing to grief —
   the caller only ever *pays* rent, and TTL extension cannot move funds or
   change stream state.

   **Exception: terminal streams (`Cancelled` and `Depleted`) are rejected.**
   Both entry points return `Error::StreamTerminated` when called against a
   settled stream. The floor TTL applied at the time of cancellation/depletion
   covers any remaining withdrawal tail; after that, callers should use
   `RestoreFootprint` rather than extending. Keepers should filter terminal ids
   out of their sweep batches.

Views deliberately do **not** extend TTL. They are called through simulation,
where a footprint write is at best noise. Keeping a stream alive is the explicit
job of `extend_stream_ttl`.

### Retention policy by state

Every touch tops the entry back up to one target — the stream's remaining
effective life plus the 30-day buffer, inflated by a 20% close-time safety
margin, floored at `MIN_STREAM_TTL_LEDGERS` (~30 days plus the margin) and
clamped to the network's `max_entry_ttl`. The close time the conversion
assumes is measured, not assumed, with the margin covering drift
([`KNOWN-LIMITATIONS.md` §5](docs/KNOWN-LIMITATIONS.md)). The threshold equals
the extend-to, so an entry below its target is topped back up to it in full —
and one already funded past the target keeps its higher balance: rent is never
clawed back, so a stream entering a terminal state decays toward its floor
rather than dropping to it. State only changes what "remaining life" means:

| State | Rent target on any touch | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `Active` | remaining effective life (schedule plus any accumulated pauses) + buffer | funded to its end plus the keeper's working window |
| `Paused` | stretched end (schedule + accumulated and in-progress pauses) + buffer | a paused stream is not settled; its end slides forward in wall-clock terms |
| `Cancelled` | the floor | cancel collapses the schedule onto "now", so remaining life is zero (a cancel before `start_time` still funds up to the unopened start); the floor keeps the vested tail withdrawable and the final state indexable |
| `Depleted` | the floor | fully paid out is not the same as forgotten; the terminal record stays readable |

The instance entry (the id counter) is always extended to the network maximum,
whatever the streams are doing.

Expired and missing records: an archived entry is restored by the invocation
that touches it, so a stream that archives is not a failure the caller has to
handle — see the caveat below. The contract itself answers an id it cannot see
with `Error::StreamNotFound` (#1), which is now reachable only for ids that were
never issued; a call that fails this way mutates nothing, and both halves of that
contract-side story are pinned by deterministic assertions in `test::ttl`.
Batch calls differ by design: `batch_withdraw` fails the whole batch with
`StreamNotFound`, while `batch_extend_ttl` skips unknown ids so a keeper's
sweep survives a stale index. Because a read restores an archived entry rather
than failing, `stream_exists(id) == false` while `id < stream_count()` is
**not** an "archived, not nonexistent" signal — the poll that would observe it is
itself what restores the entry.
[docs/KNOWN-LIMITATIONS.md §1](docs/KNOWN-LIMITATIONS.md) records the measurement
that settled this.
Expired and missing records: on a live network a transaction touching an
archived entry fails **before** the contract executes and must be resubmitted
with a `RestoreFootprint` (see the caveat below). The contract itself answers
an id it cannot see with `Error::StreamNotFound` (#1), and a call that fails
this way mutates nothing — both halves of that contract-side story are pinned
by deterministic assertions in `test::ttl`. Batch calls differ by design:
`batch_withdraw` fails the whole batch with `StreamNotFound`, while
`batch_extend_ttl` skips unknown ids so a keeper's sweep survives a stale
index, but fails the whole batch with `StreamTerminated` if any id belongs to
a terminal (`Cancelled` or `Depleted`) stream. `stream_exists(id) == false`
while `id < stream_count()` is the
integrator's signal for "archived, not nonexistent"; whether that signal holds
against a real RPC is exactly the stage-4 territory
[KNOWN-LIMITATIONS.md §1](KNOWN-LIMITATIONS.md) tracks.

### What the tests prove, and what they do not

The SDK's test host runs storage in recording mode, where reading an expired
persistent entry is **silently auto-restored** rather than failing. That is what
the live network does too — established on testnet on 2026-09-28, see §1 of
[docs/KNOWN-LIMITATIONS.md](docs/KNOWN-LIMITATIONS.md) — so `test::ttl` proves the
rent arithmetic, the extend-on-touch behaviour, that a year-long stream survives
on keeper sweeps alone, and that crossing the archive/restore boundary preserves
every field of the accounting with the pool still backing it.

What it does not measure is the **cost** of that restoration: the rent for
everything an invocation resurrects is charged to that invocation, so an
unexpectedly archived entry turns a cheap call into an expensive one. That is the
argument for running a keeper against `batch_extend_ttl` rather than relying on
the automatic path. The host-side limitation this section used to carry —
that a real network might fail the read instead — did not materialise.

## Function surface

```rust
// Lifecycle
create_stream(sender, recipient, token, deposit,
              start, end, cliff,
              cancellable, pausable, transferable) -> u64   // sender auth; cliff_mode = Schedule
create_stream_with_cliff_mode(sender, recipient, token, deposit,
              start, end, cliff, cliff_mode,
              cancellable, pausable, transferable) -> u64   // sender auth
top_up(stream_id, amount)                                   // sender auth
withdraw(stream_id, amount: Option<i128>) -> i128           // recipient auth; None = max
batch_withdraw(recipient, stream_ids) -> i128               // recipient auth
cancel(stream_id)                                           // sender auth
batch_cancel(sender, stream_ids) -> BatchCancelOutcome      // sender auth
pause(stream_id) / resume(stream_id)                        // sender auth
transfer_recipient(stream_id, new_recipient)                // recipient auth

// Views (read-only, no TTL side effects)
get_stream(stream_id) -> Stream
withdrawable_of(stream_id) -> i128
vested_of(stream_id) -> i128
refundable_of(stream_id) -> i128
stream_count() -> u64
stream_exists(stream_id) -> bool

// Maintenance (permissionless)
extend_stream_ttl(stream_id) -> u32
batch_extend_ttl(stream_ids) -> u32
```

Both classic keypairs and custom `__check_auth` smart accounts work everywhere.

### Events

`stream_created`, `withdrawn`, `cancelled`, `paused`, `resumed`, `topped_up`,
`recipient_transferred`, `ttl_extended`.

Declared with `#[contractevent]`, so their schemas are embedded in the deployed
contract's interface spec — the indexer and TypeScript SDK generate typed
decoders from the contract itself rather than hand-rolling topic parsers.

Every event carries `stream_id` as a topic, plus the addresses an indexer routes
on, plus enough state to reconstruct the stream without replaying from genesis.
Field order and topic placement are ABI: adding a field is compatible,
reordering one is not.

---

## Repository layout

```
contracts/stream/
  src/
    lib.rs              contract entry points
    accrual.rs          pure vesting math, no Env
    storage.rs          storage access and TTL policy
    events.rs           event definitions
    types.rs            Stream, StreamStatus, DataKey
    error.rs            typed errors (discriminants are ABI)
    test/               140 tests, staged by build order
```

`accrual.rs` takes a `Stream` and a timestamp and returns a number — no `Env`, no
storage, no host calls. That keeps the interesting arithmetic in one auditable
place and makes the vesting model property-testable without a Soroban host, so a
case costs microseconds instead of a host invocation.

### The archival probe: a deliberate exception

`contracts/archival-probe/` is a **throwaway** contract, not part of the product.
Its entire purpose was to answer the one question the unit suite structurally
cannot — what a live network does when an invocation touches an archived
persistent entry. It answered it on testnet on 2026-09-28 (see
[docs/KNOWN-LIMITATIONS.md §1](docs/KNOWN-LIMITATIONS.md) and
[`script/archival-canary.sh`](script/archival-canary.sh)), and the canary is now
retired. It writes a persistent entry and deliberately never extends its TTL, so
it archives on the network's minimum schedule. For what the harness asserts, and
how to read it, see the [archival canary runbook](docs/archival-canary.md).

It remains a **workspace member** — so `cargo test --workspace`, `cargo fmt --all`
and `cargo clippy --all-targets` keep covering its smoke test — but it is
**explicitly excluded from release artifacts**: `script/release.sh` builds only the
`fluxora-stream` package and rejects a probe wasm among its outputs. To build the
probe on its own, use the explicit command:

```bash
cargo build -p fluxora-archival-probe --target wasm32v1-none --release
```

This is the documented design decision for issue #1543.

---

## Non-goals for v1

No admin key, no upgradeability, no global pause. No fee mechanism. No on-chain
stream discovery. No multi-token streams. No unlock curves other than cliff plus
linear. No cross-chain anything.

---

## Status

Stages 1–3 complete: contract core, full lifecycle, TTL and resource limits.

**Stage 4 (in progress).** Deployed to testnet as
[`CBCGTSCJ…THXW`](https://stellar.expert/explorer/testnet/contract/CBCGTSCJXBMPPPE4BPDIPYZXPE2J5TQEKD2KCS7VQF533NKKEYGUTHXW);
`script/testnet-exercise.sh` calls every entrypoint against the live deployment
and passes 35/35 assertions.

Its acceptance criterion — the live archival restore round trip — is **not yet
met**. A canary entry was planted on 2026-08-12 and archives ~2026-08-19; see
[docs/KNOWN-LIMITATIONS.md §1](docs/KNOWN-LIMITATIONS.md) and
`script/archival-canary.sh`.

Then the indexer, keeper and TypeScript SDK (stage 5), reference UI last (stage 6).

Migrating from the pre-rewrite contract? See [docs/MIGRATION.md](docs/MIGRATION.md) — the
frontend's four contract calls all break, the backend is unaffected.
